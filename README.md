  # Proportional Navigation ðŸš€

  This is a unity demo sandbox I made while researching the basics of missile guidance systems.
  It implements: 
  - Augmented Proportional Navigation

  - Simplified Proportional Navigation

  - Line of sight Navigation

It took a Liiiitle bit of time to figure out how to implement the maths into a untiy game but was interesting overall.\

 ### Go to the webpage and mess around, fire some missiles, look at the code, weep at the many mistakes.

TODO
 - [ ] Change wording of true navigation to augmented
 - [ ] Add true navigation

Thanks!
